    Our Market share program offers our customers at the Westside Community Market an opportunity to support the farm at the start of the growing season by paying ahead for their season of market shopping. This is a free-choice share, subject to market availability. Members shop from a prepaid card at the stand, and enjoy other benefits of being a member of the Blue Moon community. *NOTE that our Farmers' Market stand is at the Westside Community Market in Madison, not at the farm. *
