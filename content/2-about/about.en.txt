  contentheading: About Kristen
  contenttext: "I'm Kristen, the owner and primary manager at Blue Moon. I began my career in the Hudson River Valley of New York as an apprentice at Roxbury Farm CSA. This immersion experience of tending 40 different crops on over 30 acres with the guidance of gifted farmers got me hooked on growing vegetables and the CSA model itself. After working for CSA farms for 4 years in New York and Wisconsin, I started Blue Moon Community Farm in 2004 on a piece of rented land south of Madison. "

  contentheading: About Blue Moon
  contenttext: >
    Over 10 years have passed, and Blue Moon
    has grown from a 1 acre plot to over 6
    acres of intensive production. We serve
    an on-farm CSA program, a stand at the
    Westside Community Market in Madison,
    and several area chefs. In 2008, I
    purchased our current farm and moved
    Blue Moon to its current, permanent
    location in the beautiful Town of Dunn.
    I still love what I do, and feel that
    our small acreage gives us the
    opportunity hone our skills, know our
    customers, and be good stewards to our
    land. I live on the farm with my
    husband, who does freelance ecological
    consulting from a home office, and our
    son Cyrus, born May of 2013. A
    diversified vegetable farm, even a small
    one, cannot be run well without the work
    of many hands, and I am joined each year
    by a crew of assistant managers, field
    employees and worker shares.
